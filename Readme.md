# go-enet
Enet-CSharp ([github.com/nxrighthere/ENet-CSharp](https://github.com/nxrighthere/ENet-CSharp)) bindings for Go using cgo.

# Note
This is just a port of [github.com/codecat/go-enet](https://github.com/codecat/go-enet) for [ENet-CSharp]((https://github.com/nxrighthere/ENet-CSharp)) which has independent enet implementation with a modified protocol.

## Installation
Works out of the box!

* Not Tested
* Cross compile untested

```
$ go get github.com/TubbyStubby/go-enet-sharp
```

## Usage
```go
import "github.com/TubbyStubby/go-enet-sharp"
```

The API is mostly the same as the C API, except it's more object-oriented.

## Example
Check upstream for examples and make changes where necessary.
